<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="in-the-mountains">IN THE MOUNTAINS</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent">“<span class="small-caps">In</span> the mountains,” says Nietzsche,
“the shortest way is from summit to
summit.” That is the way I covered
Donegal. Instead of descending into the valleys (a
tedious and destroying process at all times), I crossed,
like the king of the fairies, on a bridge of wonder:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line">On his stately journeys<br/></div>
<div class="line">From Slieve League to Rosses.<br/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What seems in places in this book a fathomless <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">madhm</i>
is in reality bridged over with wonder&mdash;dark to the senses
here and there, I grant you, but steady and treadable in
proportion to the amount of vision one brings to the
passage of it. All, I know, will not follow me (the fairies
withhold knowledge from the many and bestow it on the
few), but if blame is to be given let the fairies get it, and
not me. And I may as well warn the reader here that it
is unlucky to curse the fairies. Rosses is but a storm’s
cry, and&mdash;the curse always comes home to roost!</p>

<p>With regard to the pictures illustrating the book, several
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_2" title="2"> </a>
people who have seen them in the original have criticised
their darkness, as if they were all drawn “in twilight
and eclipse.” But the darkness of Donegal was the first
thing that struck me when I crossed the frontier at
Lifford, and the forty miles’ journey through the hills to
Ardara bit the impression still more deeply into me. And
if I were asked now after a year’s exile what I remember
most vividly of the county, I should say its gloom. I can
see nothing now but a wilderness of black hills, with black
shadows chasing one another over them, a gleam of water
here and there, and just the tiniest little patch of sunlight&mdash;extraordinarily
brilliant by contrast with the general
darkness&mdash;on half a field, say, with its mearing-stones, to
relieve the sense of tragedy that one feels on looking at
the landscape.</p>

A patch of sea-bog before, exhaling its

Ricks of black turf stacked over it here and there, ready
to be creeled inland against the winter firing. The dark
green bulk of Slieve a-Tooey rising like a wall behind, a wisp
of cloud lying lightly upon its carn. The village of Maghery,
a mere clachan of unmortared stone and rain-beaten
straw, huddling at its foot. A shepherd’s whistle, a cry
in torrential Gaelic, or the bleat of a sheep coming from
it now and again, only to accentuate the elemental quiet
and wonder of the place. The defile of Maum opening
beyond, scarped and precipitous, barely wide enough to
hold the road and bog-stream that tumble through it to
the sea. The rainbow air of our western seaboard enfolding
all, heavy with rain and the fragrance of salt and peat
fires.</p>

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>

now,” said a beggar, stopping on the road to have a
word with me&mdash;the sort of person one meets everywhere
in Ireland, friendly, garrulous, inquisitive, very proud
of his knowledge of half-secret or hidden things, and
anxious at all times to air it before strangers. “We do
have a power of them this speckled weather.” He looked
into the sky with a queer look, then started humming
over the names of the colours to himself in Irish. “And
they say, sir, it’s unlucky to pass through a rainbow.
Did you ever hear that?”</p>

every day&mdash;the thrown sea, the silver rush of the meadow,
the lights in distant towns&mdash;is to be living, and not merely
existing. I pity the man who is content to stay always
in the place where his mother dropped him; that is,
unless his thoughts wander. For one might sit on a

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="women-and-hares">WOMEN AND HARES</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">It’s</span> curious in Donegal sometimes,
when going along the road, or crossing
a footpath through the fields, to
see a shawled woman, a perch or so off, dropping over the
edge of a hill, and then when you get up to the edge there
is no sign of her at all. And, maybe, a pace further on
you will start a hare out of the hollow where you think
the woman should have been, and you begin to wonder
is there any truth in the story about women&mdash;that have
to do with magic and charms and old freets, and the
like&mdash;changing into hares, after all! I have had many
experiences like that in my travels through the county,
and in not a few instances have I been puzzled how a
figure&mdash;silhouetted sharply against the skyline, and only

architecture; its colour suggests time-stained walls, with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
quiet aisles and mouldering altars where one might kneel
and dream away an existence. When you meet a stranger
going the road that winds through it, like a coil of incense
suspended in mid-air, you expect him to look at you out
of eyes full of wonder, and to speak to you in half-chanted
and serious words, stopping not, turning neither to left

its tall carmine spray, growing on ditches in the sun, in
dark, shady places by the side of rivers, and under arches.
Then the king-fern, the splendid <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">osmunda regalis</i>; the

brier-roses and woodbine; the drooping convolvulus; blue-bough;

than a herb, but beautiful to look at and most serviceable
to the dyer; eyebright and purple mountain saxifrage;
crested ling; tufts of sea-holly, with their green, fleshy,
spiked leaves; and lake-sedge and sand-grass, blown

surely a paradise of herbs and flowers.</p>

<p class="no-indent">“<span class="small-caps">The</span> words of the maker <ins title="o">of</ins>
poems are the general light and
dark.” One feels the truth of
this saying of Walt Whitman’s in a place like the Pass
of Glengesh, or the White Strand outside Maghery.
Chanting a fragment of the “Leaves” one night in the
Pass, when everything was quiet and the smells were
beginning to rise out of the wet meadows below, I felt how
supremely true it was, and how much it belonged to the
time and place&mdash;the darkness, the silence, the vibrant
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>
stars, the earth smells, the bat that came out of the
shadow of a fuchsia-bush and fluttered across a white
streak in the sky beyond. And I have tried Wordsworth’s
sonnet beginning, “The world is too much with us,” by
a criterion no less than that of the Atlantic itself, tumbling
in foam on the foreshore of Maghery when daylight was
deepening into twilight, and the moon was low over the
hills, touching the rock-pools and the sand-pools with
flakes of carmine light. When I said the sonnet aloud to
myself it seemed to rise out of the landscape and to
incorporate itself with it again as my voice rose and fell
in the wandering cadences of the verse. Nature, after
all, is the final touchstone of art. Tried by it, the
counterfeit fails and the unmixed gold is justified.</p>

well, you think nothing of kicking him about as you
would an old cast shoe? And the minute the soul goes,
and the body is stiffening in death, you draw back from
him, hardly daring to touch him for the dread that is on
you. Would you answer me that, gaffer?” I was silent.
“It’s a strange world, sure enough,” said the tramp.
He rose from the gripe where he lay making rings in
the grass with his stick. “Good-day, gaffer,” said he.
“God speed your journey.” And he took the road,
laughing.</p>

herd of cattle that the district contained between these
two fires, as a preservative, to guard them against all the
diseases of that year. It is from that fire thus made that

into it by the greyness of one’s own experience. Those
dark hills with the rack over them and the sun looking
through on one little patch of tilled land, and the stone
mearings about it, figure forth the sorrow that is the
heritage of every Irishman; the darkness the sorrow, the
sunshine the hope, iridescent and beautiful, but a thing
of moments only and soon to fade away. I stand on the

murmurs continually at my feet. A duck splashes, and
flaps dripping into the greyness overhead. Not a soul is
in sight&mdash;only a blue feather of turf-smoke here and
there to show that human hearts <em>do</em> beat in this wilderness;
that there are feet to follow the plough-tail and
hands to tend the hearth. The sense of wonder over-masters
me&mdash;the wonder that comes of silence and
closeness to the elemental forces of nature. Then the
mood changes, and I feel rising up in me the sorrow that
is the dominating passion of my life. Do many people
go mad here? I have heard tell that they do, and no
wonder, for one would need to be a saint or a philosopher
to resist the awful austerity of the place.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="the-poor-herd">THE POOR HERD</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">There</span> is a poor herd at Maghery&mdash;a
half-witted character&mdash;who lives all his
days in the open, with nothing between
him and the sky. He was herding his cows one evening
in a quiet place by the caves when I happened on him.
“What time o’ day is it?” says he. “Just gone four,”
says I, looking at my watch. “What time is that?” says
he, in a dull sort of way. “Is it near dark?”</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="a-mountain-tramp">A MOUNTAIN TRAMP</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Bearing</span> south by the Owenwee river
from Maghery, we strike up through
Maum gorge. Outside Maghery we
come on two men&mdash;one of them a thin, wizened old
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>
fellow with no teeth; the other a youngish man, very
raggedly dressed, with dark hair and features like an
Italian. The old man tells us in Irish (which we don’t
follow very clearly) to keep up by the river-bed, and we
can’t possibly lose our direction. A quarter of a mile
further on we meet another man. He bids us the time
of day in passably good English. I answer in Irish,
telling him that we are on the road for Glen-Columcille,
and asking him the easiest way over the hills. He repeats
what the old man told us, viz., to keep to the river-bottom,
and to cut up then by the fall at the head of
Maum to Laguna, a cluster of poor houses in the mountain
under Crockuna. “When you get there,” he says,
“you cannot lose your road.” He comes a bit of the
way with us, and then we leave him at a point where the
track ends in the heather, and where a squad of navvies
is engaged laying down a foundation of brushwood and
stones to carry it further into the hills. It gives us a
shock, in a way, to come on this squad of wild-looking
men in so lonely and desolate a place.</p>

<p>We are now well into the gorge, and a wild place
it is! Half-way up we come on a house&mdash;if one could
call it such&mdash;with a reek of blue smoke threading out
of a hole in the thatch. No other sign of life is
visible. The walls of the gorge close in darkly on
every side except the north. On that side is the sea,
white on Maghery strand, and stretching away, a dull
copper-green colour, into the sailless horizon beyond.
Hearing the voices, a young man comes out from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>
between two boulders serving as a sort of gateway to
the house. His face is tanned with sun and exposure,
and he is in his bare feet. We greet him in Irish and
he answers&mdash;a little surprised, no doubt, at hearing the
language from strangers. Then another man comes
forward&mdash;a brother, if his looks don’t belie him. He
is in his bare feet also, and hatless, with a great glibbe
of black hair falling over his eyes. “You have the Irish?”
he says. “It’s newance to hear it from townsfolk.” We
talk for a while, enquiring further as to our direction over
the hill, and then we push on. Near the head of the
gorge we sit down to have a rest, sitting on a rock
over the stream, and bathing our hands and faces in the
brown, flooded water. All the rivers of Donegal are
brownish in colour, and the Owenwee (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">recte</i> <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Abhainnbhuidhe</i>,
“yellow river”) is no exception. The water
stains everything it touches, and I have no doubt but
that the dark colour of the people’s skin is due, partly,
to their washing themselves in it. Coming through one’s
boots, even, it will stain the soles of the feet.</p>

<p class="caption">ON THE ROAD TO DOON WELL.</p>
</div>

<p>We resume our journey, and after some rough and steep
climbing reach the plateau head. Loch Nalughraman, a
deep pool of mountain water, lies to the east of us, shimmering
in the grey morning light. All around is bogland,
of a dull red colour, and soaking with rain. We make
through this, jumping from tuft to tuft, and from hummock
to hummock, as best we can, going over the
shoe-mouth occasionally in slush. In an hour or so
we come on a bridle-path of white limestones, set on
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>
their flat in the spongy turf. We follow this for a
while, and in time reach the poor village of Laguna.
Entering into one of the houses I greet the bean-a’-tighe
in Irish. She rises quickly from her seat by
the hearth where she has been spinning&mdash;a crowd of
very young children clinging to her skirts. She is a dark
woman, with mellow breasts, and fine eyes and teeth.
She is barefooted, as usual, and wears the coloured head-dress
of her kind, curtseying to me modestly as I
approach. She answers me in Irish&mdash;the only language
she knows&mdash;and bids me come in. “<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Beir isteach</i>,” she
says. A young man of five-and-twenty or thereabouts is
weaving in the room beyond. (I recognised the heavy
click-clack, click-clack, click-clack of the loom as I
entered.) Hearing my enquiry he rises up from his seat,
drops his setting-stick, and offers to guide us as far as
the southern edge of the hill. “You will see the Glen
road below you,” he says, coming out in his bare feet into
the open, and speaking volubly, like one used to good
speech. “Look at it beyond,” he says, “winding from
the Carrick side. Keep south, and you will strike it after
two miles of a descent.” The woman brings a bowl of
goat’s milk to my sister. She drinks it readily, for she
is thirsty after her climb. Then, thanking the poor people
for their hospitality, we say, “<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Slán agaibh</i>,” and press
forward on our journey to Glen-Columcille.</p>

<p>We reach the high-road in about half-an-hour, near a
school-house, shining white in the sun, and busy with the
hum of children singing over their lessons. Things look
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>
more familiar now. We pass many houses, with fleeces
of dyed wool&mdash;green and blue and madder&mdash;drying on
bushes outside the doors, and men busy stacking turf and
thatching. Here and there on the road flocks of geese
lie sunning themselves, head-under-wing. As we draw
near they get up and face us with protruding necks,
hissing viciously. Dogs bark at us occasionally, but not
often. (I had heard ill accounts of the Donegal dogs
from travellers, but on the whole, my experience of them
has not been quite so bad as I had been led to expect.)
Slieve League rises on our left, a dark, shadowy bulk of
mountain, shutting off the view to the south. All around
is moorland, with a stream in spate foaming through a
depression in it, and little patches of tilled land here and
there, and the inevitable brown-thatched cabin and the
peat-reek over it. After some miles’ travelling we come
on a little folk-shop by the road&mdash;a shop where one might
buy anything from a clay-pipe or a lemon to Napoleon’s
Book of Fate. The window looks tempting, so we go in.
The shopkeeper is a quiet-mannered little man, not very
old, I would think, but with greyish hair, and eyes that
look as if they were bound round with red tape&mdash;burnt
out of his head with snuff and peat-smoke. We ask
him has he any buttermilk to sell. He hasn’t any,
unfortunately&mdash;he is just run out of it&mdash;so we content
ourselves with Derry biscuits, made up in penny cartons,
and half a dozen hen-eggs to suck on the way. Some
people may shiver at the idea of it, but raw eggs are as
sustaining a thing as one could take on a journey! We
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>
pay our score, and get under way again. At a bridge
where the road forks we sit down and eat our simple
repast. A bridge has always a peculiar fascination for
me&mdash;especially in an open country like this where one’s
horizon is not limited by trees and hedges&mdash;and I could
spend hours dawdling over it, watching the play of sun
and shadow on the water as it foams away under the
arches. Here there is a delightful sense of space and
quietness. The heather-ale is in our hearts, the water
sings and the wind blows, and one ceases to trouble about
time and the multitude of petty vexations that worry the
townsman out of happiness. Did I say one ceases to
trouble about time? Even here it comes, starting one
like a guilty thing. We reach Meenacross Post-office at
four-thirty, and an hour later see the Atlantic tumbling
through rain on the age-worn strand of Glen-Columcille.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="the-festival-of-death">THE FESTIVAL OF DEATH</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">I met</span> an old man on the road, and
his face as yellow as dyer’s rocket.
“Walk easy past that little house
beyond,” says he in a whisper, turning round and pointing
with his staff into the valley. “There’s a young girl in it,
and she celebrating the festival of death.”</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="in-glen-columcille">IN GLEN-COLUMCILLE</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Through</span> blown rain and darkness

Beevna is a shadow, the crosses shadows. Only one
friendly light burns in the valley. The patter of rain
and the dull boom of the surf ring ceaselessly in my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>
ears. The hills brood: my thoughts brood with them.
I stare into the sunset&mdash;a far-drawn, scarlet trail&mdash;with
mute, wondering eyes. Remoteness grips me, and is
become a reality in this ultimate mearing of a grey,
ultimate land.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="the-brink-of-water">THE BRINK OF WATER</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">I have</span> often heard it said that what
passes for folk-lore is in reality book-lore,
or what began as book-lore got
into the oral tradition and handed down through the
generations by word of mouth. A young Ardara man, a
poet and dreamer in his way, told me that poetry most
frequently came to him when he was near water; wandering,
say, by the edge of Lochros, or looking down
from Bracky Bridge at the stream as it forced its way
through impeding boulders to the sea. I asked him had
he ever read “The Colloquy of the Two Sages<a name="FootnoteMarker_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="footnote-marker">(1)</a>”? He
said that he had not. I told him that in that MS. occurred
the passage: <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">ar bá baile fallsigthe éicsi dogrés lasna filedu
for brú uisci</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, “for the poets thought that the place
where poetry was revealed always was upon the brink of
water.” Nettled somewhat, he confessed that he got
the idea from his father, a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">seanchaidhe</i>, since dead, who
knew something of Irish MSS., and who perhaps had
read the “Colloquy,” or at all events, had heard of it.
But apart from the fact of the thing having been given
him by his father, he felt that it was true in his own experience&mdash;that
poetry always came to him more readily
when he was near water.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="the-swallow-mark">THE SWALLOW-MARK</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">There</span> is a lot of the wanderer in
me, and no wonder, I suppose; for
I have the swallow-mark&mdash;a wise
man once showed it to me on my hand&mdash;and that means
that I must always be going journeys, whether in the
flesh or in the spirit, or both. “The swallow-mark is
on you,” says he. “You will go wandering with the
airs of the world. You will cheat the Adversary himself,
even that he drops his corroding-drop on you!”
And as I am a wanderer, so the heart in me opens to
its kind. I love a brown face, a clear eye, and an honest
walk more than anything; if in a man, good; if in a
woman, better. And why people look for the cover of
a roof, and the sun shining, I never can make out.
Sunshine and the open, the wind blowing, travelling
betimes and resting betimes, with my back to the field
and my knees to the sky, a copy of Raftery or Borrow
in my pocket to dip into when the mood is on me&mdash;and
I am supremely happy!</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="women-beetling-clothes">WOMEN BEETLING CLOTHES</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">I see</span> three women by a river:
they are so close to me that I
can hear them talking and
laughing. One of them is an oldish creature, the other
two are young and dark. They are on their knees on the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
bank, beetling clothes. One of them gets up&mdash;a fine,
white-skinned girl&mdash;and tucking her petticoats about her
thighs, goes into the stream and swishes the clothes
several times to and fro in the brown-clear water. Then
she throws them out to her companions on the bank, and
the beetling process is repeated&mdash;each garment being
laid on a flat stone and pounded vigorously until clean.
The women do not see me (I am standing on a bridge, with
a rowan-bush partly between them and me), so I can watch
them to my heart’s content.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">The</span> sea is one of those things you cannot

calm at times, rough at times, kind at times, treacherous
at times, but at heart unchanging: <em>not to be argued with,
but accepted</em>. Is not the comparison apter than one thinks?
Is not a man and his passions as divine and turbulent as
anything under the sun?</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">A ballad-singer</span> has come into Ardara.
It is late afternoon. He stands in the middle

a typical Ishmael and stroller of the roads. The women
have come to their doors to hear him, and a benchful of
police, for lack of something better to do, are laughing at
him from the barrack front. The ballad he is singing is
about Bonaparte and the Poor Old Woman. Then he
changes his tune to “The Spanish Lady”&mdash;a Dublin

</div>

<p>He howls out the verses in disjointed, unmusical bursts.
He acts with head and arms, and at places where he is
worked up to a particular frenzy he takes a run and gives
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>
a buck-jump in the air, blissfully unconscious, I suppose,
that he is imitating the manner in which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ballistea</i>, or
ancient dancing-songs, were sung by the Romans. At the
end of each verse he breaks into a curious chanted refrain
like: “Yum tilly-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum”&mdash;and then
there are more sidlings and buck-jumps. Some of the
women throw him money, which he acknowledges by
lifting his hat grandiosely. Others of them pass remarks,
quite the reverse of complimentary, about his voice and
ragged appearance. “Isn’t it terrible he is!” says one
woman. “Look at him with the seat out of his trousers,
and he lepping like a good one. I could choke him, I
could!” Another woman comes out of a shop with a
crying child in her arms, and shouts at him: “Will you
go away, then? You’re wakening the childer.” “Well,
ma’am,” says he, stopping in the middle of a verse, “you
may thank the Lord for His mercy that you have childer
to waken!” The ducks quack, the dogs howl, the poor
ballad-singer roars louder than ever. I listen for a while,
amused and interested. Then I get tired of it, and pass
on towards Bracky Bridge.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">In</span> the Lochros district, when the
weather begins to take up, about
the middle of May, the farmers repair to the moss on the
north side of the Point, and start cutting the banks.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>
The turf is then footed (sometimes by girls) along the
causeway ditches, and when properly seasoned&mdash;say about
the middle of July&mdash;is piled in stacks on high ground
convenient to the moss, and covered on top with a lot of
old mouldering “winter-stales,” to keep the rain off it.
“Winter-stales” are sods that have been left over from
the previous season’s cutting&mdash;the wet setting in and
leaving the bog-roads in such a state that no slipe or
wheeled car could get into them. Of course, most of the
carrying in Donegal is done by creel or ass-cart; but in
the Lochros district turf is scarce, and the farmers on
the Point are obliged to keep horses to draw the turf in
from the moss on the north side of the Owenea river,
some miles off, and over roads that are none too good for
wheeled traffic. In some cases I have noticed the “winter-stales”
built up in little beehive-shaped heaps on dry
ground, to be carted or creeled away as soon as the
weather begins to mend. But it is only the more provident
farmers who do this.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Saturday.</span> It is about half-past
seven o’clock in the evening.
The rain, which kept at it
pitilessly all the afternoon, has cleared off, and we
have left the little whitewashed inn at Glen-Columcille
refreshed, and in high fettle, for the further six miles
that has to be done before we reach Carrick, where
we mean to spend the night. We had arrived at Glen
two hours before in a weary enough condition physically
after our tramp over the hills from Ardara, and we
had almost resolved on the advice of the hostess of the
inn&mdash;a slow, deliberate, slatternly sort of woman&mdash;to
put up with her for the night; but it is wonderful
what a rest and a meal and, incidentally, a slatternly
hostess does, and so we finally decided to go on to
Carrick. We follow the road up by the telegraph posts,
and after a stiffish climb of half a mile or more, reach
the plateau head. We are now about five hundred
feet over sea level. Turning round to have a last look at
the place, we see the chapel&mdash;a plain white cruciform
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>
building, with a queer detached belfry&mdash;the little grey,
straggling village street (some of the houses with slate
roofs, some with thatch), the crosses standing up like
gallan-stones on every side of it, the deep valley-bottom
green as an emerald, Ballard mountain silhouetted against
the sunset, and the vast Atlantic tumbling through mist
on the yellow strand beyond. The air smells deliciously
of peat. In Donegal one notices the smell of peat everywhere;
in fact, if I were asked to give an impression of
the county in half a dozen words I should say: “Black
hills, brown rivers, and peat.” The road is fairly level
now, and we continue our course in a south-easterly
direction. A wild waste of moorland stretches on every
side of us, brightened here and there by little freshwater
lakes, out of which we see the trout jumping in hundreds&mdash;Loch
Unshagh, Loch Unna, Loch Divna, and another
quite near the road, where we got, at the expense of wet
feet and knees, some lovely specimens of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lilium
aureum</i>, or golden lily, which grows, I think, on every
little shallow and flat and bywater in South Donegal.
After an hour of pleasant walking the road begins to drop
and the rain to fall again. Slieve League is on our right,
but we can only see the lower slopes of it, for the cairn is
completely covered with driving mist. The wind has
risen, and the rain beats coolingly on our cheeks, and
exasperatingly, at times, down our necks. We pass a
shepherd on the road making for Malin Mór, a shawled
figure with a lantern, and several groups of boys and asses
with creels bringing turf into the stackers; and farther
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
on a side-car zig-zagging up hill on its way to the Glen.
There are two occupants, a priest&mdash;presumably the
curate of Glen parish going over for Sunday’s Mass&mdash;and
the driver. It is quite dark now, and the rain increases
in intensity. Tramping in a mountainy country is a
delightful sport&mdash;none better! But it is on such a night
and at the end of such a journey as this that one begins
to see that it has a bad as well as a good side to it. The
rain is coming down in sheets, our clothes are soaked
through, the darkness is intense, the roads are shockingly
muddy, we are tired out walking, and still we have
another stiff mile to go before we see the friendly lights of
the inn at Carrick. Two of us&mdash;R.&nbsp;M. and myself&mdash;stop
at a bridge to have a look at the ordnance sheet which
has stood us in such good stead all through our journey.
Torrential rain beating on a map&mdash;even a “cloth-mounted,
water-proofed” one like ours&mdash;doesn’t improve it; but
we have qualms about our direction. We think we should
have arrived at Carrick ere this, and we just want to make
sure that our direction is right, and that we haven’t taken
a wrong turning in the darkness. After some trouble we
manage to get a match lighted. The first misfires on the
damp emery, the second blows out, the third is swallowed
up in rain pouring like a spout through the branches
overhead, the fourth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Carrick! Carrick!
Carrick!” The frenzied cries of the advance guard
tell us that the town is in view. We put up our map
resignedly, shaking great blabs of water out of it, and push
ahead. In five minutes we have passed the chapel, with

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Noon</span> of a summer’s day. I see a
man in the fields&mdash;a wild, solitary
figure&mdash;the only living thing in sight for miles. He is
thinning turnips. Slowly a bell rings out from the chapel
on the hill beyond. It is the Angelus. The man stands
up, takes off his hat and bows his head in the ancient
prayer of his faith.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The bell ceases tolling, and he
bends to labour again.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">I met</span> a woman up Glengesh going in
the direction of the danger-post. She
seemed an old woman by her look,
but she more than beat me at the
walking. When we got to the top of the hill I complimented
her on her powers. “’Deed,” says she, with
a deprecating little laugh, “and I’m getting old now.
I’m fair enough yet at the walking, but I’m going grey&mdash;going
fast. A year ago my hair was as black as that
stack there”&mdash;pointing to a turf-stack out in the bog&mdash;“but
now it’s on the turn. And I tell you there’s only

tenants living in the mountains in-by. Little patches
of oats, potatoes, turnips, and “cow’s grass” diversify its
otherwise barren surface. There are no mearings, but each
man’s patch is marked by a cairn of loose stones, thrown
aside in the process of reclamation. The stones, I see,
are used also as seaweed beds. They are spitted in the
sand about, like a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheval de frise</i>, and in the course of time
the seaweed carried in by successive tides gathers on them,

coming into Ardara this morning from
the Lochros side, and as I came up to the chapel on the
hill I heard the bell tolling. That, I knew, was for a
burying: it was only about ten o’clock, and the Angelus
does not ring until midday. Farther on I met the funeral
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>
procession. It was just coming out of the village. The
coffin, a plain deal one covered with rugs, was carried over
the well of a side-car, and the relatives and country people
walked behind. The road was thick with them&mdash;old men
in their Sunday homespuns and wide-awakes, their brogues
very dusty, as if they had come a long way; younger men
with bronzed faces, and ash-plants in their hands; old
women in the white frilled caps and coloured shawls
peculiar to western Ireland; young married women, girls
and children. Most of them walked, but several rode in
ass-carts, and three men, I noticed, were on horseback.
The tramping of so many feet, the rattle of the wheels
and the talk made a great stir on the road, and the movement
and colour suggested anything but a funeral. Still
one could see that underneath all was a deep and beautiful
feeling of sorrow, so different to the black-coated, slow-footed,
solemn-faced thing of the towns. As the coffin
approached I stood into the side of the road, saluted, and
turned back with it the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">tri céimeanna na trocaire</i> (three

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">It</span> has been said before that there
is “too much peasant” in contemporary
Irish literature, especially
in the plays. The phenomenon is easily explained. Ireland
is an agricultural country, a country of small farms, and
therefore a nation of peasants; so that a literature which
pretends to reflect the life of Ireland must deal in the main
with peasants and the thoughts that peasants think. And
peasants’ thoughts are not such dead and commonplace
things that I, who have learnt practically all I know from
them, can afford to ignore them now. The king himself
is served by the field. Where there is contact with the
unseen in this book, with the mysteries which we feel
rather than understand, it is because of some strange
thought dropped in strange words from a peasant’s mouth
and caught by me here, as in a snare of leaves, for everyone
to ponder. Impressions, with something of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>
roughness of peasant speech in them and something of
the beauty, phases of a moment breathless and fluttering,
the mystery of the sea, the thresh of rain, the sun on a
bird’s wing, a wayfarer passing&mdash;those are the things I
sought to capture in this book.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">I was</span> talking with a fiddler the
other evening in a house where
there was a dance, up by Portnoo. I happened to mention
the name of another fiddler I had heard playing a night or
two before in Ardara. “Him, is it?” put in my friend.
“Why, he’s no fiddler at all. He’s only an old stroller.
He doesn’t know the differs between ‘Kyrie Eleison’ and
‘The Devil’s Dreams’!” He became very indignant. I
interrupted once or twice, trying to turn the conversation,
but all to no purpose; he still went on. Finally, to quiet
him, I asked him could he play “The Sally Gardens.” He
stopped to think for a while, fondling the strings of his
instrument lovingly with his rough hands; then he said
that he didn’t know the tune by that name, but that if
I’d lilt or whistle the first few bars of it, it might come to
him. I whistled them. “Oh,” says he, “that’s ‘The
Maids of Mourne Shore.’ That’s the name we give it in
these parts.” He played the tune for me quite beautifully.
Then there was a call from the man of the house
for “The Fairy Reel,” and the dancers took the floor
again. The fiddlers in Donegal are “all sorts,” as they
say&mdash;farmers, blacksmiths, fisher boys, who play for the
love of the thing, and strollers (usually blind men) who
wander about from house to house and from fair to fair
playing for money. When they are playing I notice they
catch the bow in a curious way with their thumbs between
the horsehair and the stick. At a dance it is no uncommon
thing to see a “bench” of seven or eight of them. They
join in the applause at the end of each item, rasping their
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>
bows together on the strings and stamping vigorously
with their feet.</p>

The sunlight glitters in the soft

hangs like a benediction over the countryside. A
lark is singing; the swallows are out in hundreds. The
road turns and twists&mdash;past a cabin, over a bridge&mdash;between
fringes of wet grass. It dips suddenly, then
rises sheer against a wisp of cloud into the dark bulk of
Slieve League behind. I see the mountainy people
wending in from all parts to Mass. I am standing on
high ground, and can see the hiving roads&mdash;the men
with their black coats and wide-awakes, and the women
with their bright-coloured kerchiefs and shawls. Some
of them have trudged in for miles on bare feet. They
carry their brogues, neatly greased and cleaned, over
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>
their shoulders. As they come near the chapel they
stop by the roadside or go into a field and put them
on. The young girls&mdash;grey-eyed, limber slips from the
hills&mdash;are fixing themselves before they go in of
the chapel door. They stand in their ribboned heads
and shawls pluming themselves, and telling each other
how they look. The boys are watching them. I hear
the fresh, nonchalant laugh and the kindly greeting in
Irish&mdash;“<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Maidin bhreagh, a Phaid</i>,” and the “<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Goidé mar

on the chapel wall, discussing affairs&mdash;the weather, the
crops, the new potato spray, the prospects of a war with
Germany, the marrying and the giving in marriage,
the letters from friends in America, the death and
month’s mind of friends. The bell has ceased ringing.
The men drop from their perch on the wall, and the last
of them has gone in. The road is quiet again, and only
the sonorous chant of the priest comes through the open
windows&mdash;“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Introibo ad altare Dei</i>,” and the shriller
response of the clerk, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ad Deum, qui laetificat juventutem

laboriously along in the dust, over a very rough road, tired
and travel-stained, as if it had already come a long way;
climbing stones (miniature Errigals) twenty times as
high as itself; circumventing others, falling into ruts
headlong, and rising again none the worse for its awful
experience; keeping on, on, on, “with a mind fixed and
a heart unconquered.” I couldn’t help laughing at first,
but after five minutes I felt a sort of strange kinship
with the clock&mdash;it was a wayfarer like myself, “a poor
earth-born companion and fellow-mortal”&mdash;and I stood
watching it, hat in hand, until it disappeared out of

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="teelin-bunglass-and-slieve-league">TEELIN, BUNGLASS, AND SLIEVE LEAGUE</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">It</span> is a lovely summer’s day,
warm and fragrant and sunny.
We have just come from Mass
at Carrick chapel, and are
following the road that leads south by the harbour up
to Teelin village. Numbers of people are on the road
with us&mdash;mostly women and girls, for the men have
remained behind to smoke and to talk over the week’s
happenings in the different ends of the parish. The
groups go in ages&mdash;the old women with the old women,
the marriageable girls with the marriageable girls, the
younger girls with the girls of their own age. There
is a crowd of little boys, too&mdash;active as goats, dressed
in corduroys or homespuns, and discussing in Irish
what they will do with themselves in the afternoon.
Some will go bathing in the harbour, others will go up
to the warren by Loch O’Mulligan to hunt rabbits, others
will remain in the village to watch the men and bigger
boys play at skittles in a cleared space by the high road.
I pick up with a quiet-eyed lad&mdash;the makings of a priest
or a scholar, by his look&mdash;and in a short time I am friends
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>
with the crowd. If one could see me behind I must look
like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, so many children have I
following alongside me and at my heels. They come
to know by my talk that I am interested in Irish&mdash;an
enthusiast, in fact&mdash;and they all want to tell me at once
about the Feis at Teelin, and about the great prizes that
were offered, and how one out of their own school, a
little fellow of eight years, won first prize for the best
telling of a wonder-tale in the vernacular. The quiet-eyed
lad asks me would I like to see Bunglass and the
great view to be had of Slieve League from the cliff-head.
I tell him that I am going there, and in an
instant the crowd is running out in front of us, shouting
and throwing their caps in the air&mdash;delighted, I suppose,
at the prospect of a scramble for coppers on the grass
when we get to the end of our journey. For boys are
boys the world over, let the propagandists carp as they
will! and when I was young myself I would wrestle a
ghost under a bed for a halfpenny&mdash;so my grandmother
used to tell me, and she was a very wise and observant
woman. We have come to Teelin village&mdash;a clean, whitewashed
little place on a hill, built “all to one side like
Clogher”&mdash;and from there we strike up to the right by
a sort of rocky, grass-covered loaning which leads to the
cliffs. We pass numbers of houses on the way, each with
a group of gaily-dressed peasants sunning themselves at
the door. The ascent is gradual at first, but as we go on
it gets steeper, and after a while’s climbing we begin to
feel the sense of elevation and detachment. The air is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42"> </a>
delightfully warm, and the fragrance of sea and bracken
and ling is in our hearts. In time we reach Carrigan
Head, with its martello tower, seven hundred feet odd
over the Atlantic. Southwards the blue waters of Donegal
Bay spread themselves, with just the slightest ripple on
their surface, glinting in the warm sunlight. In the
distance the heights of Nephin Beag and Croagh Patrick
in Mayo are faintly discernible, and westwards the illimitable
ocean stretches to the void. From Carrigan Head
we follow a rough mountain trail, and in a short time
reach Loch O’Mulligan, a lonely freshwater tarn, lying
under the shadow of Slieve League. Back of the loch
a grassy hill rises. We climb this, the younger boys
leading about fifty yards in front, jumping along the
short grass and over the stones like goats. Arrived at
a point called in Irish <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Amharc Mór</i>, or “Great View,”
a scene of extraordinary beauty bursts on us. We are
standing on Scregeighter, the highest of the cliffs of
Bunglass. A thousand and twenty-four feet below us,
in a sheer drop, the blue waters of Bunglass advance and
recede&mdash;blue as a sapphire, shading into emerald and
white where they break on the spit of grass-covered rock
rising like a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">sceilg-draoidheachta</i>, or “horn of wizardy,”
out of the narrow bay. Right opposite us is Slieve
League, its carn a thousand feet higher than the point
on which we stand. In the precipitous rock-face, half-way
up, is a scarped streak called <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Nead an Iolair</i>, or the
Eagle’s Nest. The colouring is wonderfully rich and
varied&mdash;black, grey, violet, brown, red, green&mdash;due, one
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>
would think, to the complex stratification and to the
stains oozing from the soft ores, clays, and mosses
impinging between the layers. We step back from the
cliff-edge, and sit down on a flat slab of stone, the better
to enjoy the view, and the boys spread themselves out in
various attitudes over the short grass before and behind
us. They are conversing among themselves in Irish,
speaking very rapidly, and with an intonation that is
as un-English as it can possibly be. The thickened l’s
and thrilled r’s are especially noticeable. To hear these
children speak Irish the way they do makes one feel that
the language of Niall Naoi Giallach is not dead yet, and
has, indeed, no signs of dying.</p>

<p>One could spend a day in this place sunning oneself on
the cliff-head, or loafing about on the grass, enjoying the

magnificence on all sides. But we have promised to be
back in Carrick for lunch, and already the best part of
the forenoon is gone. “<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Cad a-chlog é anois?</i>” I ask one
of the boys. He looks into the sky, calculates for a while,
and answers: “<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Tá sé suas le h-aon anois. Féach an ghrían</i>.”
(It is upwards of one o’clock now. Look at the sun.) In
a remote, open country like this the children are wonderfully
astute, and well up in the science of natural things.
Coming up the hill I had noticed a number of strange
birds, and when I asked the crowd the names of them in
Irish they told me without once having to stop to think.
We are ready to go now, but before setting out we decide
on having a scramble. My friend, R.&nbsp;M., takes a sixpence
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>
from his pocket, puts it edge down on the turf, and digs
it in with his heel, covering it up so that no sign of it
is visible. He then brings the boys back over the grass
about a hundred yards, handicapping them according to
age and size. One boy, the youngest, has boots on, and
he is put in front. At a given signal&mdash;the dropping of a
handkerchief&mdash;the race is started, and in the winking of
an eye the crowd is mixed up on the grass, one boy’s
head here, another’s heels there, over the spot where
the sixpence is hidden. Five minutes and more does the
scramble last, the boys pushing and shoving for all they
are worth, and screaming at the top of their voices. Then
the lad who reached the spot first crawls out from underneath
the struggling mass, puffing and blowing, his hair dishevelled,
the coat off him, and the sixpence in his hand!</p>

<p>We have got back to Carrick, an hour late for lunch,
and with the appetites of giants. We met many people
on the road as we returned, all remarkably well-dressed&mdash;young
men in the blue serge favoured by sailors, and
girls in white; a clerical student, home on holidays from
Maynooth, discussing the clauses of Mr. Birrell’s latest
Land Bill with a group of elderly folk; big hulking
fellows with bronzed faces, in a uniform that I hadn’t
seen before, but which a local man told me was that of
the Congested Districts Board; and pinafored children.
One young man we noticed sitting on a rock over the
water with his boots off, washing his feet, and several
boys sailing miniature boats made out of the leaves of
flaggers.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">I was</span> out the other evening on the
shore to the northward of Lochros,
watching the men taking in the turf
from the banks where it had been footed and dried.
The wind was quiet, and there was a great stir of traffic
on the road&mdash;men with creels, horses and carts, asses
and children driving them. An old woman (a respectable
beggar by her look) came by, and we started to talk.
We were talking of various things&mdash;the beauty of the
evening, the plentifulness of the turf harvest, the sorrows
of the poor, and such like&mdash;when she stopped suddenly,
and looked up into the sky. She gripped my arm.
“Look, look,” she said, “a shooting star!” She blessed
herself. There was a trail of silver light in the air&mdash;a
luminous moment&mdash;then darkness. “That’s a soul
going up out of purgatory,” she said.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="sunday-on-the-road-between-carrick-and-glengesh">SUNDAY ON THE ROAD BETWEEN CARRICK AND GLENGESH</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Sunday</span> on the road between
Carrick and Glengesh. It is drawing
near sunset. We pass a group
of country boys playing skittles in
the middle of the road&mdash;quite a
crowd of them, big, dark fellows, of all ages between
twenty and thirty-five. Some are lolling on the ditch
behind, and one has a flute. Farther on we come on a
string of boys and girls paired off in twos with their arms
about each other’s waists, like a procession on Bride’s
Sunday. The front pair are somewhat ill-matched. The
man is old and awkward in his walk, yet cavalierly withal;
the girl is young and pretty, with a charming white
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>
laundered dress and flowers in her hair. As our car
passes they wave their hands to us as a sign that they
are enjoying the fun quite as much as we are. We are
rising gradually towards the Pass. Below us the road
ribbons away through miles of bog to Slieve League.
There is a delightful warmth and quietness in the air.
The smoke of the cabin chimneys, as far as one can see,
rises up in straight grey lines, “pillaring the skies of
God.” The whole landscape is suffused with colour&mdash;browns
and ambers and blues&mdash;melting into infinity.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="a-roany-bush">A ROANY BUSH</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent">“<span class="small-caps">Do</span> you see that bush over there?”
said an old man to me one day on
the road near Leckconnell&mdash;a poor village half-way between
Ardara and Gull Island. “It’s what they call a
roany bush. Well, it’s green now, but in a month’s time
it’ll be as red as a fox’s diddy, and you wouldn’t know it
for berries growing all over it.”</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="august-evening">AUGUST EVENING</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">August</span> evening, moonrise. A
drift of ponies on the road. I
heard the neighing of them half an hour ago as I came
down the glen, and now I can see them, a red, ragged
cavalcade, and a cloud of dust about their heels. There are
some fourteen ponies in the drift, and three young fellows
with long whips are driving them. They give me the
time of day as I pass. One of them turns back and
shouts after me: “Would you happen to have a match
on you, gaffer?” He is a stout-built lad, with a red face,
and a mat of black hair falling over his eyes. I feel in
my pocket for a box, and give him share of what I have.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>
He thanks me, and I pass on. The air is damp and
fragrant, and wisps of fog lie along the ditches and in the
hollow places under the hills. The newly-risen moon
touches them with wonder and colour.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">A yellow</span> day in harvest. A young

in her lap, sunning herself in the under wisp of her father’s
thatch. I come on her suddenly round a bend in the
road. She is taken by surprise (almost as completely
as <em>I</em> am) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. draws her legs in, settles her clothing, half
smiles, then hangs her head, blushing with all the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">pudor</i>
of abashed femininity. I pass on.</p>

I know and feel them all.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="a-madman">A MADMAN</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">I passed</span> an old fellow to-day between
Ardara and Narin, doubled up in the

two red eyes that burned in his head like candles.</p>

<p>“Who’s that old fellow?” I asked of a stonebreaker, a
perch further down the road.</p>

<p>“Oh, never heed him,” says he&mdash;“he’s mad. This is
the sixth. There’s a full moon the-night, and he ever goes
off at the full o’ the moon. Was he coughing at you?
God, you’d think he was giving his last ‘keeks,’ to hear
him sometimes!”</p>

Interminable red bog. A cluster of hovels
on the tableland; one set this way, another that, huddling
together for company sake, it seems, in this abomination
of desolation. A drift of young children play about on
a green cleared space between the holdings. (In Donegal
one sees young children everywhere.) They run off like
wild-cats at our approach, screaming loudly and chattering
in Irish as they run. A rick of turf, thatched with winter-stales;
a goat tethered; a flock of geese; tufts of dyed
wool&mdash;red and green and indigo&mdash;spread on stones to
dry; the clack of a loom from the house nearest us; a
dog working sheep beyond.</p>

<p class="no-indent">A sheepdog with a flock of

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Up</span> Glengesh. The hills of the
Pass close in darkly on either
side of me. The brown road rises between them in
devious loops and twists to the sky beyond. There is
the smell of bog-myrtle and ling in the air, and the
sound of running water. The silence is awful. I am
going along quiet and easy-like, with hardly a thought
in my head, when near a sodded shelter, almost hidden
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>
from view in a cluster of fuchsia bushes, I come on a
little lad of about three years of age. He can’t be older,
I fancy, he is so small. He runs out in front of me,
scared somewhat at my approach, as quaint a figure as
ever I looked at. I shout at him and he stops, pulling
the hat which he wears&mdash;and it is big enough to be his
father’s&mdash;over his face, and laughing shyly at me out of
one corner of it. His hands are wet, I notice, a blae-red
colour, and sticking with grass&mdash;as if he had been
“feeling” for minnows in the stream which runs alongside
the road. He has a pair of homespun jumpers on,
very thick, and dyed a crude indigo colour, a shirt and
vest, and his legs are bare and wet up to the knees. I
ask him in English “where he comes from,” “who is his
father,” “who is his mother,” “where he lives?” He
doesn’t answer, only pulls the hat deeper over his head,
and laughs into it. I put the question to him then in
Irish.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The words were hardly out of my
mouth when he gave a leap in the air. I felt as if something
had struck me in the face&mdash;something soft and
smothering, like a bag of feathers&mdash;and I was momentarily
blinded. When I looked again who should I see
but Shan Mac Ananty, my <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">leaprachán</i> friend from Scrabo
in Down, running out in front of me, in a whirl of dust, it
seemed&mdash;a white, blinding cloud&mdash;giving buck-jumps in
the air, and dancing and capering about in the most outlandish
fashion possible.</p>

<p>“So it’s you, Shan?” I said, when I had recovered
my breath. I wasn’t a bit afraid, only winded.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>“Ay,” says he. “I didn’t know you at first. The
English is strange to me.” Then with a quaint grimace:
“What are <em>you</em> doing up here?”</p>

<p>“And what are you doing up here yourself, Shan?”
says I. “I thought Scrabo was your playground.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, son,” says he. “The old fort <em>is</em> my
playground, but the smoke&mdash;the smoke from the mill
chimneys&mdash;chases me away at times, and I come up here
for an airing. And, anyway, you mustn’t forget that I’m
king of the fairies of Leath-Chuinn,” says he.</p>

<p>“And so you are,” says I. “I clean forgot that. And
do you be in Donegal often?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Once in a spell,” says he. “I travel the townlands
in turn from Uisneach to Malin,” says he, “and it takes
me a year and a day to do the round. I saw you at
Scrabo in June last,” says he, “but you didn’t see me.”</p>

<p>“When was that, Shan?” says I, thinking.</p>

<p>“On the night of the twenty-third,” says he. “There
wasn’t a fire lighting as far as I could see; and I could
see from Divis to the Horns of Boirche, and from that
over to Vannin.”</p>

<p>A shadow darkened his queer little face. “Ah,” says
he, “they’re changed times. I was an old man when
Setanta got his hero-name,<a name="FootnoteMarker_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="footnote-marker">(3)</a> and look at me now,” says
he, “clean past my time. No one knows me, barring
yourself there. No one can talk to me; and at Scrabo
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>
it’s worse than here. They’re all planters there,” says
he, “all strange, dour folk, long in the jaw and seldom-spoken,
and with no heart in the old customs. Never a
John’s-Fire lighted, never a dance danced, never a blessing
said, never a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>He stopped, and I turned to answer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but
Shan was gone! Nothing in sight for miles&mdash;nothing
living&mdash;only a magpie walking the road, and a <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">toit</i> of blue
smoke from a cabin away down in the glen.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="a-poor-cabin">A POOR CABIN</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">A poor</span> cabin, built of loose whin
rubble; no mortar or limewash;
thatch brown and rotting. Dung oozing out of door in
pig-crew to north, and lying in wet heaps about causey
stones. A brier, heavy with June roses, growing over
south gable-end; rare pink bloom, filling the air with
fragrance.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="the-flax-stone">THE FLAX-STONE</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">Outside</span> nearly every house in Donegal&mdash;at
least in the north-western parts of it&mdash;is
the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Cloch Lín</i>, or “Flax-Stone.” This is
a huge wheel of granite, half a ton or more in weight,
revolving on the end of a wooden shaft which itself turns
horizontally on an iron spike secured firmly in the ground.
The purpose it serves is to “break” the flax after it has
been retted and dried. On the long arm of the shaft
tackling is fixed for the horse supplying the motive power&mdash;much
in the same way as it is in a pug-mill or puddling
machine used in the old days by brick-makers. The flax
is strewn in swaths under the wheel, which passes over
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>
it repeatedly, disintegrating the fibre. The scutch-mill,
of course, is a more expeditious way of doing the work,
but Donegal folk are conservative and stick to the old
method&mdash;which must be as old, indeed, as the culture
of flax itself is in the country.</p>

<h2 class="no-page-break"><a name="after-sunset">AFTER SUNSET</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="small-caps">I was</span> coming through Ardara
wood the other evening just after
sunset. There was a delightful smell of wet larch and
bracken in the air. The road was dark&mdash;indeed, no more
than a shadow in the darkness; but a streak of silver
light glimmered through from the west side over the
mountains and lay on the edge of the wood, and thousands
of stars trembled in the branches, touching them with
strangeness and beauty. As I approached the village I
met an old woman&mdash;I knew she was old by her voice&mdash;who
said to me: “Isn’t it a fine evening, that?” “It
is,” said I. “And look,” said she, “at all the stars hung
up in the trees!” Farther on I came on a number of
women and girls, all laughing and talking through other
in the half-darkness. I was out of the wood now and
almost into the village, and there was light enough to
see that they were carrying water&mdash;some with one pail,
others with two&mdash;from the spring well I passed on my
way up. This, I believe, is a custom in Ardara.<a name="FootnoteMarker_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="footnote-marker">(4)</a> The
grown girls of the village go out every evening after
dark-fall, if the weather happens to be good. They
meet at the well, spend half an hour or so chatting and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>
talking together, and then saunter home again in groups
through the darkness, carrying their pails, just as I saw
them on this particular evening. When I got to the
village the windows were nearly all lit up. The white
and white-grey houses looked strange and unearthly in the
darkness. The doors were open, and one could see a dark
figure here and there out taking the air. Over the roofs
the stars shone and the constellations swung in their
courses&mdash;the Dog’s Tail, the Dragon, the Plough, the
Rule, and the Tailor’s Three Leaps; and although there
was no moon one could see the smoke from the chimneys
wavering up into the sky in thin green lines. The
fragrance of peat hung heavily on the senses. There
wasn’t a sound&mdash;only a confused murmur of voices,
like the wind among aspen-trees, and the faint singing
of a fiddle from a house away at the far end of the street.
Even the dogs were quiet. I passed through the Diamond,
down the long main street next the shore, and like Red
Hanrahan of the stories, into “that Celtic twilight, in
which heaven and earth so mingle that each seems to
have taken upon itself some shadow of the other’s beauty.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">“<span class="small-caps">What</span> time o’ day is it?” My
interrogator was an old man I met
the other evening in a loaney running
down from the back of Lochros to the sands of
Lochros Beag Bay, near where the old fish-pass used to
be. I looked at my watch, and told him it was five-and-twenty
past seven. “Oh,” said he, “is it so much as that?
The darkness and the tide’ll soon be coming in, then.”</p>

They are streaked and mottled here and there with patches

Not a leaf of grass, not a frond of fern roots on these

us, tumbling through a gut in the mountainside&mdash;almost
on to the road it seems. We stand under it. We watch
the brown bulk of water dropping from the gut-head and
dancing in foam on the rocks a hundred feet below. The
roar is deafening. One might shout at the top of one’s
voice, and yet not be heard. The air is iridescent with
spindrift, which shines in the sun and sprays coolingly on
our cheeks. We lean on the bridge parapet, watching

Whitman, “is folded in a great
vocalism.” I spoke to a man to-day on the roadside,
near Maghery. He was a poor, raggedy fellow, with a
gaunt, unshaven chin and wild eyes, and a couple of
barefooted children played about the mud at his feet.
He answered me in a voice that <em>thrilled</em> me&mdash;deep, chestfull,
resonant; a voice, that had he been an educated
man, might have won fame for him, as a politician,
say, or a preacher, or an actor. And voices like his are
by no means uncommon along the western seaboard
of Ireland. Men address you on the road in that frank,
human, comrade-like way of Irishmen, out of deep lungs
and ringing larynxes that bring one back to the time
when men were giants, and physique was the rule rather
than the exception. In such voices one can imagine the
Fenians to have talked one with the other, Fionn calling
to Sgeolan, and Oisin chanting the divine fragments of
song he dreamed in the intervals of war and venery.
Will Ireland ever recapture the heroic qualities&mdash;build
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>
personality, voice, gesture&mdash;or, as Whitman puts it:
“Litheness, majestic faces, clear eyes”&mdash;that were hers
down to a comparatively late period, and in places have
not quite died out even yet? I believe she will.</p>
